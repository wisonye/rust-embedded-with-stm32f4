# All-in-one Manual For `Rust` Embedded programming on `Mac`

In this manual, we will cover all the knowledge we need to know for using `Rust` to do embedded programming.

And we pick the `ARM-based MCU STM32F4` series chips as our target to run all the demos.

## Important concepts

#### 1. What is `MCU` and `Soc` ? What makes it different than `SBC`?

- `MCU` stands for `Microcontroller Unit`.
- `Soc` stands for `System-on-chip`.
- `SBC` stands for `Single Board Computer`.

Summaries, `MCU` and `Soc` sound like the same thing which is an all-in-one chip. It includes all the hardware
components below inside the single-chip:

- CPU (even FPU)
- RAM (Random Access Memory)
- ROM (Read-only Memory)
- Flash (as the hard drive to store your program)
- Any related I/O

It's basically a very small computer on an `IC` (integrated circuit) or microchip. Compare to `SBC`, it got a few different below:

- `MCU` usually with limited hardware power resources which suit for non-heavy computation solution.
- `MCU` can deal with fast power on and off at any given time and won't hurt your program which `SBC` can't do like that (as it got 
`OS` on it).
- `MCU` doesn't have `OS` at all, your program will be the **only** one program running there with full control and real-time responsiveness.

#### 2. What is `STM32`?

`STM32` is a family of **32-bit** `MCU` by **STMicroelectronics**. The `STM32` chips are grouped into related series that are based around the same **32-bit** ARM processor core, such as:

- **Cortex-M33F**
- **Cortex-M7F**
- **Cortex-M4F**
- **Cortex-M3**
- **Cortex-M0+**
- **Cortex-M0**

The `F` means with `FPU` (Floating Point Unit).

Internally, each `MCU` consists of the processor core, static RAM, flash memory, debugging interface, and various peripherals.

The company behind the `Arm` trademark (`Arm Holdings`) doesn't actually manufacture chips for purchase. Instead, their primary business model is to just design parts of chips. They will then license those designs to manufacturers, who will in turn implement the designs (perhaps with some of their own tweaks) in the form of physical hardware that can then be sold.


### 3. The hardware we will use in the demo

**STM32F407G-DISC1** (replaces **STM32F4DISCOVERY**) dev board which with the `STM32F407VG` high performance `MCU`.

About the `STM32F407VG`:

High-performance foundation line, ARM **Cortex-M4** core with **DSP** and **FPU**, 1 Mbyte Flash, 168 MHz CPU, ART Accelerator, Ethernet, FSMC

## Setup environment

Before we can write rust and test it on emulator or the real hardware, we need to install 
some tools below:

#### 1. Install tooling
- `rust` and related binaries
    
    ```bash
    # Install latest rustup
    - `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`

    # `cargo-generate` used to generate the rust embedded project from template
    - `cargo install cargo-generate`

    # `cargo-binutils` is a collection of cargo subcommand LLVM tools. Like:
    # `rust-objdump`,
    # `rust-readob`,
    # `rust-ld`,
    # `rust-lld`,
    # `rust-lld`,
    # `rust-nm`,
    # `rust-size`,
    # etc.
    - `cargo install cargo-binutils`

    - `rustup component add llvm-tools-preview`

    # Add cross-compilation target
    rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabi
    rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf
    ```

- `QEMU` ARM emulator and `STM32F4` support

    ```bash
    brew install qemu
    ```

    `QEMU` is a generic and open source machine emulator. By default, it doesn't
    support `STM32F4`, below is the steps how to make that happen:

    ```bash
    # Detail is here: https://xpack.github.io/qemu-arm/install/
    cd ~/Downloads/
    curl -LJO "https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/qemu-arm-xpack/releases/download/v2.8.0-9/xpack-qemu-arm-2.8.0-9-darwin-x64.tar.gz"
    mkdir -p ~/Library/xPacks/qemu-arm/2.8.0-9
    cd ~/Library/xPacks/qemu-arm/2.8.0-9
    tar xvf ~/Downloads/xpack-qemu-arm-2.8.0-9-darwin-x64.tar.gz
    mv xpack-qemu-arm-2.8.0-9/* ./
    rm -rf xpack-qemu-arm-2.8.0-9/
    chmod -R -w ./

    # Add `/Users/wison/Library/xPacks/qemu-arm/2.8.0-9/bin` to your `$PATH`
    # After that, test it:
    qemu-system-gnuarmeclipse --version

    # List all support machine and we should be able to see `STM32F4XXX`:
    qemu-system-gnuarmeclipse -machine help
    ```

- ARM version `GDB` and `OpenOCD` for remote debugging

    `GDB` isn't able to communicate directly with the ST-Link debugging hardware on your STM32F3DISCOVERY development board. It needs a translator and the Open On-Chip Debugger, `OpenOCD`, is that translator. `OpenOCD` is a program that runs on your laptop/PC and translates between GDB's TCP/IP based remote debug protocol and ST-Link's USB based protocol.

    `OpenOCD` also performs other important work as part of its translation for the debugging of the ARM Cortex-M based microcontroller on your STM32F3DISCOVERY development board:

    It knows how to interact with the memory mapped registers used by the ARM CoreSight debug peripheral. It is these CoreSight registers that allow for:
    Breakpoint/Watchpoint manipulation
    Reading and writing of the CPU registers
    Detecting when the CPU has been halted for a debug event
    Continuing CPU execution after a debug event has been encountered
    etc.
    It also knows how to erase and write to the microcontroller's FLASH

    ```bash
    brew install armmbed/formulae/arm-none-eabi-gcc
    brew install openocd
    ```

#### 2. Create `demo` project from template

```bash
cargo generate --git https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m-quickstart
ðŸ¤·  Project Name: demo
```

</br>

#### 3. Run hello example in `QEMU` and set break point in `ARM GDB`

- Add the below settings to `.cargo/config` 

    ```js
    [target.thumbv7em-none-eabi]
    # Settings below will make `cargo run` execute programs on QEMU
    # Normal version
    # runner = "qemu-system-gnuarmeclipse -cpu cortex-m4 -mcu STM32F407VG -machine STM32F4-Discovery -nographic -semihosting-config enable=on,target=native -kernel" # Normal version (show dev board UI)
    # Normal version (with dev board UI)
    runner = "qemu-system-gnuarmeclipse -cpu cortex-m4 -mcu STM32F407VG -machine STM32F4-Discovery -semihosting-config enable=on,target=native -kernel"
    
    # Debug version, QEMU wll wait for the GDB connection from TCP port 3333 and halt the machine.
    # runner = "qemu-system-gnuarmeclipse -gdb tcp::3333 -S -cpu cortex-m4 -mcu STM32F407VG -machine STM32F4-Discovery -nographic -semihosting-config enable=on,target=native -kernel"
    # Debug version (with dev board UI), QEMU wll wait for the GDB connection from TCP port 3333 and halt the machine.
    # runner = "qemu-system-gnuarmeclipse -gdb tcp::3333 -S -cpu cortex-m4 -mcu STM32F407VG -machine STM32F4-Discovery -semihosting-config enable=on,target=native -kernel"


    [build]
    # As we use STM32F4DISCOVERY, then pick the `Cortex-M4F`
    # target = "thumbv7em-none-eabihf" # Cortex-M4F and Cortex-M7F (with FPU)
    
    # But if running in QEMU, then we can't use the FPU version, as QEMU doesn't support!!!
    target = "thumbv7em-none-eabi"   # Cortex-M4 and Cortex-M7 (no FPU)
    ```

- Run `qemu` in debug mode with `cargo run --example hello`

- Now we're able to run arm version `GDB` and connect to debug TCP port:

    ```js
    arm-none-eabi-gdb \
    -q target/thumbv7em-none-eabi/debug/examples/hello \
    -ex "target remote:3333"

    # List the `main` fn then we can set breakpoint to the line number we want:
    (gdb) list main
    (gdb) break 13
    Breakpoint 1 at 0x484: file examples/hello.rs, line 13.

    (gdb) step
    (gdb) print &x
    (gdb) next
    (gdb) continue 
    (gdb) stop 
    (gdb) quit
    ```

</br>
    
#### 3.1 Run hello example in hardware

- First, make sure you go through this [step](https://rust-embedded.github.io/book/intro/install/verify.html) to 
make sure all hardware connections already work.

- We use `--target` in `cargo` command, then we don't need to modify `.cargo/config` again

    ```bash
    cargo run --target thumbv7em-none-eabihf --example hello
    ```

- For debugging, plz follow steps [here](https://rust-embedded.github.io/book/start/hardware.html)
