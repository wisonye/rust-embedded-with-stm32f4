The `MCU` runs on a specified working frequency, that's why we need to set the system clock (`SYSCLK`) working frequency. Usually, that frequency generated by multiple `Clock Sources`.

So, we can use the default clock source chose by the chip or we need to pick the one we need, and that process is called **`Clock Source Selecting`**.
