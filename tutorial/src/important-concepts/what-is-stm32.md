`STM32` is a family of **32-bit** `MCU` by **STMicroelectronics**. The `STM32` chips are grouped into related series that are based around the same **32-bit** ARM processor core, such as:

- **Cortex-M33F**
- **Cortex-M7F**
- **Cortex-M4F**
- **Cortex-M3**
- **Cortex-M0+**
- **Cortex-M0**

The `F` means with `FPU` (Floating Point Unit).

Internally, each `MCU` consists of the processor core, static RAM, flash memory, debugging interface, and various peripherals.

The company behind the `Arm` trademark (`Arm Holdings`) doesn't actually manufacture chips for purchase. Instead, their primary business model is to just design parts of chips. They will then license those designs to manufacturers, who will in turn implement the designs (perhaps with some of their own tweaks) in the form of physical hardware that can then be sold.
